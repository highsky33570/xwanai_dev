The project structure is in .projectrc, api definition in /openapi.json, database definition in .definitionrc, .note is for all my manual note you should check upon when updating the codebase. Should there be any database/api error that is required to fix, remind me if I should update these definitions.


The expected DOM format is described in the format of
```
DOM{
    (flex-row, height 2)[
        (flex-col, items-center)
        character name:text-xl text-primary,
        character birthday: text-sm, "born yy-mm-dd"
        --
        character starsign: string text-primary text-sm
    ]
}

Where:
"--" means space-between  
"==" means use default flex layout  
">>" and "<<" means flow direction.   
"[]" indicates a container.  
"()" indicates hint or coment.  
"," indicates seperation of element under same layout structure.  
":" indicates a memo at a single element level.  
"\\""(quote) marks a string literal.
